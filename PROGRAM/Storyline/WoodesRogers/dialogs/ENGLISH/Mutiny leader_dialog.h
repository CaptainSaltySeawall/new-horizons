"Not you Captain: You are voted out Mr Pyle!",
"!!!",
"First you told us to leave the food behind - 'to keep the hold empty for all treasures'. We're starving Captain!", 
"The crew have their rum!!",
"And then you refused to take that fine ship - just because she 'looked British'!!",
"We'll soon find another prize...",
"Not so fast there Mr Pyle. Before you depart to your new island - hand over all your belongings!",
"What, you can't really mean...",
"As you seem to think that we can live on rum only - here have a bottle.",
"No weapons, nothing else?",
"You're allowed to take a weapon with you - with ONE shot!",
"(sigh)",
"This be MY ship now - ",
"- and I'm not looking to add any more crew!",
"A starving and deadly drunk crew -",
"- is a very dangerous thing!",
"Pirates attack ships -",
"- from ALL nations!",
"This will be a new experience for you 'Captain'. With no crew to push around you have to search all locations rigorously yourself for hints, items, new exits or anything interactive.",
"Yeah, and without us Officers you have to trust your own ability to solve problems and puzzles.",
"And Pyle do us a favour and stop your stupid talk about reincarnation - it simply doesn't exist!",
