"Can't you see that I'm on duty! Don't bother me.",
"All right, all right.",
"Did you want to report some crime?",
"No, of course. I am a captain, after all...but I see you are not listening.",
"Remember - we don't allow fighting in the streets. You can defend yourself, of course, if somebody attacks you.",
"Right, I'll consider that information.",
"Such unbearable weather...and I've got to stand here in it. You may not believe me, but my only pastime is fighting the flies that try to land on my face.",
"That's most unfortunate, but I can't help you. It's your duty.",
"If you want to chat, find somebody else. I've got my duty to do, and it's not my duty to talk to you.",
"I was just wondering whether you are alive or not. You are standing here like a statue.",
"Do you think it's easy to protect our city? Not at all! It is a very important and dangerous job. I remember once...",
"Tell me some other time. I've got to go.",
"Go your way, don't bother me.",
"As you say, soldier.",
"Hey! Will you bring me a cup of rum from the tavern?",
"Perhaps. But won't they hang me up for helping a soldier get drunk on duty? No, wait 'til they change the guard, and then you can drink as much as you wish.",
"Why must it be a rough-looking sailor like you trying to talk to me?! Aren't there any beautiful women in this city?",
"And you call this doing your duty? Look, you wouldn't want to miss capturing some dangerous criminal like myself, would you? Ha-ha!",
"You look pretty healthy. Don't you want to join our army? We've got lots of room in our barracks, good food, rum for free.",
"Sounds good, but I'll have to decline your offer. Army discipline doesn't agree with me.",
"This heat.... I'd give anything to return back to the Europe, to the civilization...",
"Yes, it doesn't look like this weather suits you.",	//21
"Halt! I have never seen you before, but you have the face of a pirate! Can you prove that you are none?",//22
"I'm Captain Howard Pyle and here are my comission and ship's papers, to prove it.",
"Papers... hah. May be all right - or not. That name sounds very piracy... piratesey... pirashy... ehh...",//24
"Yes...? (How hard can it be)",
"What's your business in the Fort, 'Captain'?",								//26
"I'm just passing the Fort to the Prison. I'm been doing some research.",
"No. You can't do that without a Pass!",								//28
"I see. But that's just what I've got here, soldier. Signed by Sir William Stapelton himself!!",	
"More papers, hah. Take a look at this, Frank... Best to be sure.",	//30
"Is there something wrong?",
"Well... ehh... ehh, I think it's a correct document. But... the Pass is for you alone Captain.",
"Alright then.",
"Open the gate Beefheart, you've got the keys.",
"(Come on)",
"Not so fast there. Show me your papers, if you got any. If not...",
"Well of course Sir.",
"Hmm, maybe this document is genuine after all. Move on before I change my mind.",	//38
"Ehh... my document please.",
"What about it?",				//40
"Can I have it back, please.",
"Certainly not. You have used it and I have accepted it. Now get out of my sight.",	//42
"But I'll need it on my way back through the Fort. Without it the soldiers will attack me!",
"I tell you what: I really don't care. Get lost or you'll be attacked now!!",		//44
"(have to solve that later on)",
