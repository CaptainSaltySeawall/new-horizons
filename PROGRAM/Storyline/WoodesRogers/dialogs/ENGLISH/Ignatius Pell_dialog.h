"What do you want, Captain?",
"Oh nothing.",
"What do you want from me?",
"Captain Howard Pyle, did you perhaps spend time in prison with Major Stede Bonnet?",
"Pyle.. ehh!! I've heard about the mutiny. Not the best reputation for a Pirate Captain.",
"It was all a misunderstanding. Now to the Bonnet business. Did you serve under him, Mister Pell?",
"And if I did - what are you willing to pay, Captain?",		//6
"Just tell me the story and we'll see.",
"No that's not the way it works. You get me out of here and I'll tell you all about the notorious gentlemen of fortune.",   //8
"Alright, agreed then. (how am I'm gonna do that?)",
"Maybe I can trust you even if you have the look of a pirate. This is what happened...",		//10
"Yes..?",
"Now that was really a clever move, Captain. 'Took' is very addicted to liquor. If we're lucky he'll be sleeping soon.",//12
"That's my chance! Meanwhile you could tell me the Bonnet story.",
"What exactly is it you want to know, Captain? I served a long time under Major Stede Bonnet.",		//14
"I know that you were first imprisoned in Charleston in the Maltains cells. What about the the rest of the crew?",
"We were separated from them because we agreed to testify against them.",		//16
"You did, ehh?! And by 'we' you mean Bonnet and yourself?",
"... and David Herriot, the Navigator. You have to understand - it was our last chance to survive.",	//18
"Alright. And then you were moved here. What happened when Stede Bonnet tried to escape?",
"The Major bribed our 'friend' Tookerman here. He, Herriot and two other men succeded in escaping from this place.",	//20
"How could he do that - he couldn't possibly have any gold with him in prison?",
"You're right, but he had a small piece of paper which Took took (hah) as payment.",	//22
"(YES YES YES that could be it) Did you see what kind of paper that was, mister Pell?",
"Captain Pyle. I can't read or wright, I was only the Boatswain.",			//24
"Very well. So Tookerman helped them out of here - but they were caught. Right?",
"Stede Bonnet was caught on Sullivan Island. Herriot, the indian and the negro were killed.",		//26
"(so maybe the map piece could still be here?) Why didn't you follow them?",
"I thought my chances to survive was bigger if I stayed. And as you see I'm one of the few still alive. 30 out of Bonnet's 35 men were hanged.",//28
"And the four others?",
"In the cell next door, the court couldn't prove they were pirates, only maroons.",	//30
"Who's got the cell keys, Mister Pyle?",
"Tookerman's got'em. But you still have to defeat the four guards.",			//32
"Hmm...",
