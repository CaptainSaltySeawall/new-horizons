"What is it - are any of my ships on fire?",
"No, I just...",
"It's locked!",
"But havn't you heard, there are some ships arriving!",
"Oh, I have seen ships before.",
"These come all the way from Sweden, bringing all sort of goods.",
"I don't care for the swedish food any longer - it's so disgusting.",
"Hmm, I see. (How do I get this man out of there?)",
"And that good folk, will end today's quality auction.",
"Welcome back next week. Same time, same place. Then we're selling the personal belongings of another notorious pirate. Who you say? Come and see...",
"Yes, what can I do for you?",			//10
"Uhh.. about the auction today. I want to know who bought the items.",
"To make a private deal with them eh?",
"Maybe so. Do you have a list?",
"Sure. But it's not for free.",
"I see. How much do you want for it?",		//15
"Well... lets say...  4000.",
"I have travelled a long way and am tired so... okay I'll buy it.",
"That's a ridiculous price. Maybe I come back later.",
"Very good, Captain. The money please..",
"Here you are. Good bye.",			//20
"The auction is over, but you're welcome next week.",
"Alright.",
"And who might you be!!",
"Ohh. Sorry for this intrusion, madame. My name is Howard Pyle.",
"Are you a thief? Are you searching my husbands office?",		//25
"Not at all, madame. I can explain...",
"You look very much like a pirate to me.",
"I was looking for the Governor that's all. I want to offer him an business proposal.",
"Too bad he's not here then. He has gone to meet the ship. I think it's best you leave now Mr Pyle.",
"Of course, nice to meet you madame.",		//30
"Mr Pyle, just a minute. I don't believe you for a second and if my husband the governor finds out...",
"I am an ordinary tourist visiting Kristiania for the very first time and I would like to see the whole town...",
"Tourist - hah! You're not allowed to enter the Fort.",
"No. Maybe you know the password madame?",
"I see no harm in that. It's 'Långtora'",	//35
"'Lang toray'. Got it.",
"Oh for god's sake. It's pronounced 'Long-tour-ahh'.",
"Yes, just what I said. Thank you and good bye, madame.",
"Good bye Mr Pyle.",
"Good bye madame.",				//40
"Talk to the Cardinal - he's the one in charge here.",
"Where is that bl**dy priest. He's supposed to be present while he's waiting a visit from Rome.",
"Finland huh. I have never met the priest anyway, Monsigneur.",
"Polite young man, ehh. Also the convenient exit via the confessional box is locked.",
"Okay...?",					//45
"It means I can't even search him in his quarters.",
"Where does he live then?",
"He's got a room in the local tavern. Not appropiate at all.",
"No, it sounds very questionable - for a priest. (what do I care - but maybe I'll need that information later)",
"Talk to the Priests - I'm only the Cardinals guard.",		//50
"Rome? Fortelius doesn't sound italian at all.",
"No actually I'm from Finland.",
"That priest is not coming - we're leaving soon!",
"I see, Monsigneur.",
"No, I havn't bought any Amulet. How could I afford that?",		//55
"Hmm, it has to be the other Church then. The one in the spanish quarters.",
"Why so surprised to see us here? We can't make a living only based on 'piracy'.",
"No, ehh hrmpff. (Neither can I)",
"If you're looking for the Governor, he's out for some hours.",
"I see. (Hmm, maybe I can sneak around a little?)",
