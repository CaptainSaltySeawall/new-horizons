"Governor Eden saved me in the last minute. But who's the new Captain?",
"I'm Howard Pyle. Why did Eden let you live?",
"Shut up Hennington -",
"- this is none of your business!",
"The Governor guessed that I had got a map-piece from Teach too. He pressed me to find out where it was.",
"And you revealed it?",
"No. I lost it during the final battle. And that's the truth.",
"I see. Did you ever notice where the Governor kept his own map-piece?",	//10
"No, maybe in his office. We servants were never allowed to enter.",
"I am interested in buying the Estate. Can I take a look inside?",
"This man is a thief Mrs Pough. If you don't believe me -",
"- ask him what he was doing in the Governors study.",
"Hah, I'm just leaving this place -",						//15
"- together with my friends!",
"I'll follow you.",
"Very good.",
"Alright, let's talk about the map-pice, Captain Pyle.",
"You've got it?! We are one step closer then.",
"I want a share of the treasure if you find it.",
"Of course - equal shares for all. Now hand it over.",
"Well Captain Pyle, what have you found out so far?",
"I have found the wreck of Teach's last sloop.",		//24
"Did you search the Hold?",
"Yes, and even the Gunpowder Storage if you should have hidden it there.",
"But I did. What did you find?",
"Nothing but Gunpowder.",
"Hmm, maybe it's still there under the Gunpowder.",
"Let's go to Turks then!",					//30
"I know that Teach's sloop was sold to a trader in Turks.",
"And more..?",
"I've talked to him but havn't found the wreck yet.",
"I placed the map-piece in the Gunpowder Storage. Maybe it's still there.",
"I havn't found the wreck in Turks yet.",			//35
"Lieutenant Maynard got the sloop as a reward. He lives in Citadel Rock on Eleuthera island.",
"Let's go to Eleuthera then!",
"Maybe Samuel Odel from Smugglers Lair on La Grenade knows what happened to the Sloop.",
"Let's go to La Grenade then!",
"And there's no other way to get into the Office?",				//40
