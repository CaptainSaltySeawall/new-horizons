"Yes?",
"Goodnight, I'm Dom Guillermo de la Rosa, envoy of the King. I arrived today from Spain. May I know your name?",
"My name is Lucia Montavez.",
"Montavez? Do you belong to the Governor's family?",
"I'm his daughter.",
"Pleased to meet you. I didn't know he had a daughter... so beautiful.",
"(She blushes) Thank you. You're courteous.",
"I only say the truth. I also noted you seemed to be bored.",
"These kind of meeting are above all for men. Discussing of politics, wars and so on are not my favourite topics.",
"I understand.",
"Dom Guillermo, we talked so much I didn't see the time. It's late, I must go.",
"Sorry, you're right. I didn't note I was speaking for one hour...",
"Well, I appreciated your company tonight. Maybe, you could see me tomorrow?",
"I hope so. Tomorrow, your father wants to show me the town, I don't know when I can join you.",
"I'll be in the residence's garden tomorrow afternoon, try to be there if you can.",
"I'll try. See you, Lady Montavez.",
"Dom Guillermo?!",
"Good afternoon, Lady. Have you got any trouble with this man?",
"Gentlemen, I don't want to be responsible of a quarrel. Dom Ortega was about to leave.",
"Thank you, Dom Guillermo. I appreciate your help.",
"Sorry for stopping your discussion but I didn't like the way he talked to you. Who is he?",
"Dom Sebastian Ortega, a young nobleman of Cartagena. His family rules the slave trade of this colony and is one of the richest of the Caribbean.",
"Slave trade, you said?.. I felt he had something antipathic.",
"I don't also like this kind of trade. Unfortunately, he thinks I could be his future wife.",
"And you want that?",
"No, never. However, my father is favorable to a wedding between our family and the Ortega's one.",
"And he could force you to marry him.",
"Unfortunately, yes. I try by all means to avoid this but I feel the 'deadline' is approaching.",
"Humm... Be optimistic, Lady Montavez. Things can change.",
"I hope so. And you? What are you doing here?",
"I was about to meet your father in the residence. He's waiting for me. This afternoon, we must continue the visit of the town.",
"I don't know if you'll do it today. My father is worried by some occurrences.",
"What do you mean?",
"During the lunch, he said he had to solve a problem with the Dutch quickly.",
"What problem?",
"I don't know. He doesn't usually explain me in details his work.",
"Well, I'm going to know in a few minutes if this matter is really important. Sorry Lady, but I must go and talk to your father right now.",
"Of course, Dom Guillermo. I hope to see you again quickly.",
"So do I, Lady Montavez.",
"Dom Guillermo? You here?",
"Lady Montavez, I hope I don't disturb you.",
"Not at all. What's the goal of your coming?",
"This morning I have some time to spare. So, I've had the idea of inviting you for a stroll in the town. I don't really know Cartagena and I've thought it would be more interesting to visit the town with you.",
"[She's smiling] Only suitors can invite me. Are you my new suitor?",
"[Embarrassed] OUH.. OUH.. Sorry, I choked. No, I'm not your new suitor. Everybody knows your suitor is Dom Ortega.",
"[Annoyed] That's what he wants but only in his dreams I could marry with him !",
"[THINKS: Good news!] But, as I said the last time, if your father wants to, you'll have to do it.",
"I think I'll be able to change his mind about the wedding. But, stop talking about Dom Ortega. I'm going to prepare for the stroll.",
"Thank you to accept my invitation. I'll be just outside waiting for you.",
"OH MY GOD ! What happened ?",
"Don't worry, Lady Montavez. I have been attacked by brigands but everything is fine now.",
"Brigands here ? I'm amazed. This location is the more secure of Cartagena.",
"Well, there is a beginning for everything. Not sure, you want to stroll with me now?",
"No, we can still do that. I'm going to ask to the Captain of the guards to let some of his soldiers to protect us during the stroll.",
"As you wish.",
"Thank you, Dom Guillermo for this stroll. I really enjoyed to be with you.",
"It was a pleasure for me. I hope we'll do another strolls over the next days.",
"Of course, why not tomorrow morning at the same hour?",
"Wonderful ! I'll be at your home tomorrow. See you, Lady Montavez.",
"What happened, Dom Guillermo? I've heard a big explosion in the town and when arriving at the port, I saw the fort burning.",
"I need to tell you the truth. I'm not Dom Guillermo, the King's envoy. I'm Bartolomeu o Portugues, a pirate.",
"What are you talking? Are you joking?",
"No, I'm telling you the truth. I've used the King's envoy identity to accomplish the mission of doing as much damage as possible in Cartagena.",
"So, you're a criminal. Why did you betray me?",
"I'm not more criminal than the Spanish politics managed in the Caribbean. But, I didn't want to see you to talk about that. I just want to know if you agree to leave Cartagena and be with me.",
"If I agree, I must betray my father and my family. Do you realize what you ask?!",
"Humm... That means you don't really love me.",
"I don't know... I'm confused by this situation.",
"Well, I knew this meeting could finish like that. Unfortunately, I cannot stay more time in Cartagena to continue our discussion. I'm going to ask to my crew to let you in the port. Maybe, it's the last time we are together. Goodbye Lucia. I won't forget the moments we spent here.",
