". Do you have business with the Spanish Navy? If not, please leave, as I am very busy.",

"Yes. I am ",
". I was asked by ",
" to bring you this, which I took from the naval building at #sPointe a Pitre#, #sisland_Guadeloupe#.",
"Yes, I received a letter about you. As for what you have brought, their military value earns you 5000 piastres. The documents",
" tell me all I need to know about a forthcoming French attack on #sSantiago#.\nUnfortunately, the attack will be led by the '#swarship#'. We have nothing available which can match her. ",
"\nPlease leave now. I must consider what to do about this.",
"Very well. Goodbye and good luck, ",
"\nBut I gather that you are the sort of #sperson# who takes risks for money. If so, perhaps you can help.",
"That would depend on the risk and the money.",
"Both are high. I need you to return to #sSantiago# and evacuate the governor.",
"\nI have only two ships available at the moment. If you agree, I shall order both to sail with you in case you encounter the French fleet.",
"Then I shall leave for #sSantiago# at once. You had better be serious about the money, ",
"Sorry, but no amount of money is worth the risk of going up against the #swarship#. There's not much point in having a pile of gold if you're not alive to spend it.",
"Why are you still here?",
". I have brought this, which I took from the naval building at #sPointe a Pitre#, #sisland_Guadeloupe#.",
"Well done, ",
"! As a reward, here are 5000 piastres. The documents which you have brought",
" to offer my assistance in the defence of #sSantiago#. He believes, as do I, that having taken #sRedmond#, the French will attack #sSantiago# next.",
"That is my assessment too. Undoubtedly the '#swarship#' will lead the attack as she did at #sRedmond#. And we have nothing available which can take her on.",
"Then there is little point in me being here.",
"Not so, Capitán. You will be well paid if you return to #sSantiago# and evacuate the governor.",
