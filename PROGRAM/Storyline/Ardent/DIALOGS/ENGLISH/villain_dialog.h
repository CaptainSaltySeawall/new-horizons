"Yes? Have you business here, ",
"No, I must have walked through the wrong door. I'll see myself out.",
"Get out! You have already disgraced yourself here. Leave, or do I need to have you thrown out?",
"Relax, I'm leaving.",
"Oh, look.  Another vagabond.",
"My name is ",
" and I'll have you know I'm no vagabond, I'm a sea captain!",
"Oh look, a vagabond with a ship. I suppose you've come to ask for a job?",
"As it happens, yes. Have you any work which requires a ship?",
"It's your lucky day, vagabond. This letter needs to go to ",
" of the governor of #sSantiago#. Deliver it, then bring the answer to me and you will be paid.",
"You may consider the letter as good as in ",
"'s hands already.",
"Well? Did you deliver the letter?",
"Not yet. I shall sail for #sSantiago# soon.",
"Yes. ",
" is looking forward to the wedding.",
"Not quite. A servant insisted on taking the letter and delivering it himself.",
"Yes, but you're not going to like the answer. ",
" does not seem to like you much and dreads the day of the wedding.",
"No, a servant wanted to take the letter from me, which I would not allow.",
"You lie! I do not know what you have really done with the letter but you certainly have not delivered it. Begone and never visit this house again!",
"Where did you hear that? Never mind - you certainly can't have heard it from my ",
" in person. You have failed my trust. Now get out of here!",
"Hah! That is the one thing you could have said which shows you can be trusted. I knew ",
" would not let a stranger near my dear ",
". Here is your reward. And now I have another letter for you to deliver. Also, take this ring. It marks you as my trusted agent. Show that to ",
" and he will let you through, or he'll answer to me! Deliver this one in person and bring back the reply.",
"Thank you for trusting me with this mission. You may rely on my discretion.",
"Ah, you have returned, ",
". Did you manage to deliver the letter this time?",
"Yes, but I'm afraid ",
" does not seem happy about the wedding.",
"No matter. I will soon persuade ",
" to change ",
" mind. Meanwhile, here is your reward. Now, return my ring and be gone. I don't need you any more.",
"Here, take it. It doesn't look all that valuable anyway. Goodbye.",
