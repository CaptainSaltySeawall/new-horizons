"This is a suprise, I certainly didn't expect any visitors today. Actually, I don't expect any visitors at any time. But a pleasant surprise it is.",
"Are you O'Byrne?",
"That is me name for sure, lad. But who would ye be, if I don't know of any lad or lassie 'round here that I don't know, but who knows me? If ye know what I mean. Ye don't look like a spanish colonist. Aye, yer a seafaring man, I can see! And an english one at that!",
"My name is Blaze. And if you don't know anybody, perhaps this is because you live in the wilderness of a godforsaken spanish island?",
"Aye, yer a smart lad. But if ye've been looking for me, ye know who I am, right?\nI'm an Irish sailor who volunteered for a spanish expedition! Aye, who thinks that such a creature exists? More scarce than a leprechaun they are, but here I am! I have a bad knee, courtesy of a shrapnel I took just off #sisland_Redmond#, and that's when it was time to settle down. Not much left for me in the old country, so one more time: Here I am!",
"That's an interesting story and it sounds almost as crazy as you look. So you truly are a hermit? You live here all by yourself?",
"This should answer yer question, lad! Blaze, this here's me daughter Annie, my dearest treasure. She's been out on the hunt so we have more to bite than fish and oatmeal! Annie, say hello to Blaze. He's a sailor and interested in old hermits, ha ha!",
"Daughter, ey? I can see the similarity.", // 7
"French pirates! Now we're in trouble!",
"What business would french pirates have here?",
"Hide and plot their next roguery I say! Aye, they don't have their eyes on #sGrand Cayman#, there's not much to gain in that jerkwater town. But the coast with its coves and islets is the perfect hideout to attack shipping between the mainland and ports like #sHavana# and #sRedmond#. Maybe the Frenchmen are not as stupid as they normally look!",
"...",
"The problem is, if they land in the bay and set up their camp here somewhere, we won't be save, Annie and me. Ye don't think stinkin' pirates would be peaceful neighbours to us? They'd kill us for joy or worse! We couldn't go out to hunt and chop wood, we'd have to hide in here shiverin', hopin' they won't discover us. Aye, Annie and meself, we can put up a fight, but we won't last. I can barely walk with this busted knee of mine.",
"Has something like this happened before, O'Byrne?",
"Aye, but back then, the pirates left the island after three days when a hefty storm came this way. But those three days were hell, livin' on the brink of being at the mercy of french scoundrels. I says we won't be that lucky every time.",
"But the spanish colonists at the settlement, wouldn't they take you in? Wouldn't they do anything about the corsairs at all?",
"Yer funny, lad. Perhaps they're shiverin' like us. Perhaps they believe it's none of their business as long as the French don't attack #sGrand Cayman#. And no, they won't take us in. They hate us way too much\nWhy ye think we live out here? Because of the fresh air, sure. But also because the Spanish laugh at me limping and spurn me irish heritage. If there's one thing they hate more than me, it's Annie. Her mother was a spanish lass from the town, whom they taunted from the moment her belly started to grow.\nWhen the blasted fever took her, Annie and me were cast out. We prefer not to go to this hideous town.",
"That's terrible. But these people must have some kind of governor or whatever they call their local bigwig. I go there now, and talk to him.",
"Yer a good lad. Frankly I don't believe ye can convince him to even lift a butt cheek for us. But we're glad yer helpin' us.",
"I'll be back soon.", // 19
"Ye find the guvnor in the townhall of #sGrand Cayman#. If there's someone who can persuade him, yer that man, Blaze!",
"I see what I can do.",
