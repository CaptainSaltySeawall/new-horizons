"Welcome to our island. Pray tell me your name.",
"My name is ",
"And to what do we owe the pleasure of your company on this fine day?",
"I am looking for Captain Short Jack Gold, Sir. Can you help me find him.",
"Is that so? And why would you be looking for him? You don't know him do you?",
"No Sir, I don't, but I have a letter from my father which says Captain Gold would be able to help me in a matter of some importance.",
"I see.. And who is your father?",
"My father has passed away. He name was Eugene Devlin.",
"Ah! Eugene Devlin.. Yes I know him, or rather knew him. Well, Captain that changes things. I am the Short Jack Gold you are seeking, how might I be of assistance?",
"Captain Gold, this is going to sound awfully silly, but my father's letter tells me to ask you if you would like to go swimming. Here you may read it.",
"Ha! Ha! Ha! It does it indeed! That old fox Eugene, as crafty as ever! But true to his word.",
"Sir! That is my father you speak of, and I would ask you to show more respect.",
"Calm down. I mean no disrespect to your father. In fact I honor his skill in imparting such an important message in such a simple way.",
"Important message? What do you mean?",
"Many years ago, your father and I, and one of the members in this room found a vast treasure, but it was stolen from us. It appears, however, that your father finally located it, and as promised, has sent us word of it's whereabouts.",
"How can you tell that from me asking you to go swimming?",
"It actually says SWIM not swimming, and that is part of the code we set up years ago. I regret I have pressing matters to which I must attend, so I cannot help you further, except to say in memory of your father, you can have our share of the treasure.",
"Thank you Captain Gold, that is very generous of you.",
"Your father helped the brotherhood when we badly needed it, even though it cost him dearly. It is only proper that we should return the favour.",
"What did he do?",
"No matter. It is better left untold. As for you, you may approach any member here and they will assist you in finding the treasure. Select with care as each member has his or her own particular talents. You may talk to each member once and move on to another if you wish, but, if you speak to a member twice, by the code, that is the member you have chosen. I wish you good fortune Miss Devlin",
"Thank you again Captain Gold.",
