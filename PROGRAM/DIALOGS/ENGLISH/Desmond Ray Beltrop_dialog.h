"Did Skull send ye? If not, yer gonna look pretty funny trying to put yer brains back in yer head.",
"You kiss your mother with that mouth? Skull says stay away from his Snakebite stash.",
"So, Governor ",
"Robert Christopher Silehard",
" sends me his right-hand #sgender#. What does he want from me, #sdiminutive#?",
"Who says I work for him?",
"What makes you think I'm here on the governor's orders?",
"I beg your pardon, but do I look like the village idiot? The moment I learned someone was looking for me, I made inquiries\nWould you look me in the eye and deny you've been working for him for the past several months?",
"Okay, let's say you're right, and the governor sent me. What difference does that make? Would you refuse to talk to a representative of the governor?",
"Look, I've had about enough of this cat-and-mouse. Are you going to talk with me, or would you rather choose which of your legs you want to keep?",
"Captain, I wonder if you know who you're speaking to. You must trust me when I say that if I didn't want to talk to you, you would not be standing here.",
"Oh, there's no need for physical violence, #sdiminutive#. I'll speak with you because I'm curious: What does that old fox, the governor, want from me?",
"Fine. I need to know where I can find a gentleman by the name of ",
"Raoul Rheims",
". I know he's hiding somewhere on this island.",
"Your information is out of date, matey. ",
"Raoul Rheims",
" did indeed spend a couple of days here, virtually never left his house, but he's already set sail again, and he kept his destination secret even from me. Clearly, he was worried about something, but I couldn't say what.",
"He has a house here? Where can I find it?",
"Has a shack here on the island, does he? Where is it?",
"Just a moment, #sdiminutive#. You may well be an envoy of the English governor, but that doesn't give you leave to invade another man's home and paw through his belongings. Do I make myself very clear?",
"I humbly request that you to make an exception for me, sir. I must find out where ",
"Raoul Rheims",
" was sailing to, and as soon as possible!",
"Oh, come now. You're a smuggler, known all over the archipelago for your lack of principles. You're going tell me about the law?",
"I can see you won't listen to reason. If I can't convince you to stay away from that house, I'll simply order my men to stand watch over it and shoot on sight. I'm sure even you can take a hint from a musket ball. Now, scram!",
"Goodbye.",
"This isn't over!",
"Please leave my house. I'm busy and I don't have time to talk to you.",
"...",
"I see you have responded to my request. I am very glad of that...",
"I hope this whole spectacle of an invitation is not played out to avenge me for breaking into the house of Rheims!",
"Have you come back to inform me that you have decided to accept my offer?",
"Yes, I think it suits me.",
"No, I'm still considering it.",
"Well, let's see. No, you still can't take the amount of cargo you need on board.",
"Okay, I'll take that under advisement.",
"Good! I see you've managed to unload the hold and can proceed with my assignment.",
"I'm looking forward to it.",
"Where have you been all this time, ",
"?!",
"Trying to find a roomier vessel...",
"Glad to have you back. I hope everything went well? Although. from the look on your face, I don't think I'm getting my hopes up.",
"Alas, I have nothing to tell you. The deal went through, but before Maginot handed me the money, he was arrested by the soldiers.",
"I see you're back. I hope you brought money and good news?",
"Yes, although that bastard Jean set me up big time.",
"I see you're back. I hope you brought money and good news?",
"Alas. But I have proof that Jean did indeed stash the goods.",
"I see you're back. I hope you brought money and good news?",
"I didn't bring the money because that bastard Jean asked for a postponement and then sicced assassins on me!",
"I see you're back. I hope you brought money and good news?",
"No, Jean is on the verge of bankruptcy and can't pay for our cargo, which was confiscated.",
"I see you're back. I hope you brought money and good news?",
"Yeah, although that bastard, Jean, set the assassins on me.",
"Well, well, well... Who do I see! Why are you here so early? You could have stayed away for another two or three years...",
"I got caught in a storm! No... I almost got eaten by a shark!",
"You have arrived just in time, my friend. Now, let's talk to the head of the pirates. Please don't interfere unless you have to.",
"All right, I'll keep my mouth shut.",
"Damn it! I was hoping that all the issues would be resolved during the meeting, but there are even more!",
"What are we going to do next?",
"I can see by the look on your face that you didn't come back empty-handed.",
"And you're damn right I didn't! Here's the deed to the store.",
"You look a little disheveled, #sNathaniel#. Is something wrong?",
"(You recount the incident at the #sMarigot# to Beltrop, interspersed with speculation about Jean Maginot's pedigree).",
"You look a little disheveled, #sNathaniel#. Is something wrong?",
"(You recount the incident at the #sMarigot# to Beltrop in detail, embellishing it a bit so you don't look like a complete idiot in the eyes of your employer).",
"Your gloomy look tells me you've come back with nothing.... Tell me what happened.",
"(you tell Beltrop the details of your failed adventure).",
"Your gloomy look tells me you came back with nothing. Tell me what happened.",
"(You tell Beltrop the details of your failure).",
"You returned so quickly? Did you really fulfill my errand?",
"Not yet, but I have news for you. Very unpleasant news.",
"Glad to have you back. I have everything ready to go. And we can get started.",
"Godspeed.",
"Well, you're a master at putting on a spectacular fight. I've seen it all myself, it's a sight to behold.",
"Thank you.",
"I'm sorry to tell you this, but by killing Barracuda, you've lost all credibility with me.",
"",
"Never mind Rheims, we're not talking about him. But, it was your daring intrusion into his home that prompted me to have this conversation.",
"Ahem... Go on.",
"How would you like to join our brotherhood? My men risk their heads, but they also make good money\n And you, with your talents, are quite capable of becoming my assistant.... in the future. What do you say?",
"It's a tempting offer. I think I'll accept it.",
"I don't think I'm interested.",
"That's too bad. But I'm a patient man, so if you change your mind, I'd be willing to repeat my offer to you again.",
"Time will tell. Goodbye.",
"That's fine. Then let's get down to business. I don't care what flag you fly or who you fight with. The important thing is that you do my bidding...",
"Sounds like an errand boy.",
"No offense, my friend. But to be my assistant you will have to work hard. And that work will not always be pleasant.",
"I already understand... Well, what was it you wanted me to do?",
"To deliver contraband, my friend. And don't smile, I beg you\nYou may have used contraband before, but this one is a little different.",
"Sorry, I couldn't resist. Really, what else would smugglers do but deliver contraband?",
"You are mistaken, and you will soon see it. Not all my errands are so frustratingly monotonous\nBut perhaps we should get back to business after all.",
"Yes, I believe that would be the best way to continue our conversation.",
"Let's not be sarcastic, ",
"! Your talkative nature is beginning to bore me!",
"You're the one who offered me this job, so if you want me, you'll have to tolerate my way of talking as well.",
"Ahem... However... Looks like I'm already starting to regret my offer...",
"God have mercy! Do you care how I talk as long as I'm doing your errands?",
"I'll consider your words at my leisure, but in the meantime, let's get back to business. Now, your job is to deliver a shipment of sandalwood on #sisland_Saint Martin# to the shopkeeper of #sMarigot#, Jean Maginot. Don't worry, he's been warned, and you're at no greater risk than usual. I will give you your reward upon your return.",
"Hmm... Alright, wherever we are!",
"Hm. However, your ship is not big enough to do serious business. Free up some space in the hold and come back, perhaps the transportation of sandal will still be relevant.",
"I will. See you later.",
"Hmm... so... your hold will easily accommodate the entire cargo...",
"That's great! When can I leave?!",
"Don't be in such a hurry, ",
". Let me remind you again what you have to do. So, #sMarigot# on isle of #sisland_Saint Martin#, shopkeeper Jean Maginot, gratuity on arrival.",
"#sMarigot# on isle of #sisland_Saint Martin#, Maginot, money. Did I hear you right?",
"You're all being ironic... Good luck to you, my friend.",
"As they say in snowy Moscovia, where the bears live: 'To hell with it.'",
"Just hurry up! I can give this job to someone else.",
"I'll be back as soon as I can.",
"We could sail to Europe - there's a great selection of fine ships with enough cargo for any voyage...",
"Aha, I take it someone else took the sandal to #sMarigot#?",
"Yes, I just couldn't wait any longer. Every shipment, you know, has its own deadlines.",
"Hmm... What am I supposed to do now? That's it, I'm free?",
"No, no, take your time! I may have been a bit overreacting by yelling at you, but.... Anyway, we've run into some problems with this sandal...",
"Ha! What are they?",
"The deal fell through... When my man unloaded the sandal to Maginot, and went to his store to receive the money, French soldiers burst in. My man was obliged to make a hasty retreat, pretending to be an ordinary customer, but he saw at the window that the soldiers had found the hidden sandal and arrested Jean.",
"And what can I do?",
"Hmm... Why don't you tell me more about this incident?",
"(You tell him exactly what happened in Jean Maginot's store.)",
"It is not your fault that you did not complete this task to the end. Here is your reward.",
"Oh, you're very generous. But maybe there's something I can do to remedy the situation.",
"Well, you're right on the mark, and I'll ask you to return to #sMarigot# once more.",
"Ahem... Right I don't... What is it? Do you have some sort of plan?",
"I think there's something wrong here. Maginot's been crooked before, and that's what worries me.",
"You mean to say that this peddler is putting on a show to avoid paying you?!",
"Yes, I have that suspicion. It's up to you to find out if it's true.",
"Not for a 'thank you', of course?!",
"Have you forgotten? I told you I reward my men generously.",
"I haven't forgotten, but you will. You're even more slippery than Maginot, I'm afraid.",
"I would ask you, ",
"! Don't forget who you're talking to!",
"All right, all right. Get the money ready, I'll squeeze everything I can out of this rascal.",
"I want sandal or money, remember that. I don't care how you get one or the other.",
"Okay.",
"Hmm. So he's decided to play me.... But are you sure he's guilty?",
"I'm a hundred percent sure! The bastard planted the ring on me and then claimed I stole it.",
"Hmm... Alright, I'll think of a way to teach that rascal a lesson.... But did you give me my money back?",
"Yes, here it is.",
"Good, and here's your percentage of the deal. Now I'd like to give you one more thing to do.",
"I'm listening.",
"Well, that's also a result, now I'll tell you more about it.",
"(You tell Beltrop in detail the story of your capture and happy release).",
"Hmm. Well, I'll think of a way to teach that rascal a lesson..... In the meantime, I'd like to entrust you with one more matter.",
"I'm listening.",
"Hmm... Do you have any proof that these men were acting on Maginot's orders?",
"Who else could have wanted to get rid of me!",
"I don't know about that. Okay, I'm going to think about the situation for a while, and I have a new assignment for you.",
"I'm listening.",
"And I take it you haven't done any investigation into this? Such credulity does you no honor.",
"But, if I may!",
"Shut up... I'll send someone else to check on this rascal, and I have another assignment for you.",
"I'm listening to you.",
"Tell me more about what happened.",
"(You're recounting to Beltrop what happened to you at #sMarigot#.)",
"Good. I'll think about what can be done with this rascal, but in the meantime I have a new assignment for you.",
"I'm listening.",
"I need your help. The thing is, relations between us and the pirates of #sisland_Quebradas Costillas# have gotten a bit strained lately....",
"And?",
"... and I arranged a meeting with the head of the pirates, named ",
"Isenbrandt Jurcksen",
"...",
"Oh yeah, and I have to be present to provide your security?!",
"Security?! Are you laughing, #sNathaniel#? No, I need you as an extra, an entourage, for more credibility, so to speak.",
"Ahem. I see. Well, a crowd pleaser, that's a crowd pleaser. Now tell me more about it.",
"Okay. So, you're going out to sea and heading for #sisland_Douwesen#. That's where we'll meet in the bay known as 'Crab Cliffs'. Oh, and don't be late, the rendezvous is in two weeks.",
"Will do.",
"You're all joking?! I wasn't joking, by the way! You almost ruined my negotiation, so be warned, one more slip-up and I'll have to break up with you.",
"I get it.",
"I think you spent all this time at the harbour whore's house. Anyway, you failed the previous two assignments, and you failed the third. Wouldn't you go to the devil?",
"What?! How dare you talk to me like that, you bastard!",
"I'm sorry about what happened.",
"You will answer to this insult, young man! Defend yourself!",
"A mass, you say, an escort.... Now I'll show you both escort and mass! Agrgh!",
"Likewise. And what hopes you had. Farewell.",
"Farewell.",
"Thinking. I'll be doing the thinking, and I have a new task for you.",
"What is it?",
"If you remember, we had a problem with Jean Maginot.",
"You bet I did! That bastard's made me bleed so much.",
"Do you remember Jean Maginot? After you failed to return my money, I sent another man to that peddler\n And as I was informed today, that man was executed.",
"Devil! So the peddler really wasn't clean!",
"We need to teach him a good lesson. Namely, get him to sell his store to my man. How exactly you do it is of no concern to me.",
"Rest assured, I'm up to the task.",
"You have done me a great favour, my friend. Here is your reward, and I have a new task for you.",
"What is it?",
"I'm sorry to hear that. I shall have to commission someone else to buy the store, which will involve additional expenditure.",
"I did my best, but that guy was easier to kill than to persuade.",
"I'm afraid that's the end of our cooperation, #sNathaniel#.",
"To Hell with you! I almost lost my head, and you're still worrying about some store!",
"I'm sorry about what happened.",
"Don't feel bad, we all have slip-ups. Now back to business, I have a new assignment for you.",
"What is it?",
"Please! You're not talking to a longshoreman after all!",
"That's it! I'm tired of your lectures! You've had enough of it!",
"Likewise. And what hopes you had. Goodbye.",
"Goodbye.",
"Really, #sNathaniel#, you've outsmarted yourself. I'll have to send someone else to settle this matter, and I have a new assignment for you.",
"What is it?",
"As you recall, we've been having problems with the pirates, with both heads of the pirates denying any involvement...",
"Yes, I remember everything.",
"We have a problem with pirates... Or rather, people who fly the pirate flag but are not members of the Coastal Brotherhood.",
"Go on.",
"I've managed to find out that the local governor is to blame for what's going on, who has equipped a flotilla of 5 warships to fight my men...",
"You want me to deal with this flotilla?",
"That's right. Moreover, I will reinforce your flotilla with my own man.",
"But, let me tell you, I can do it myself.",
"I'm afraid that's out of the question. Now let me introduce you to your companion.",
"...",
"Well, don't stall for time, tell us what you've learned.",
"We have a traitor in our ranks.",
"Well, well. I'll tell you more from now on.",
"(You tell Beltrop what you learned in the tavern).",
"Devil! Okay, I'll deal with it, and you go on with the task at hand.",
"Okay. But I'd like to propose a plan.",
"I'm listening.",
"I need you to tell your people about a big deal coming up.",
"I understand. A traitor will inform the governor and he will try to have a punitive squadron intercept my men?",
"Exactly!",
"That's a good plan. But it will take me at least a week to implement it.",
"I can wait. Get your men ready.",
"Don't be modest, #sNathaniel# - I'm thrilled with what you've done, but now we need to have a serious talk.",
"Yes, I'm listening.",
"You have honorably fulfilled all my assignments, and as I promised you, you may take the place of my assistant.",
"I accept your offer, boss.",
"I think I'd better take your place, you dog!",
"I promised you I'd make you my assistant, but I have to disappoint you...",
"You bastard! So I've been working for you for nothing? No, that's not gonna work! Defend yourself!",
"It is unfortunate that you have made THAT choice. Try to kill me, but know that my people will still not accept you.",
"Who cares?!",
"It is unfortunate that you have made THAT choice. Try to kill me, but know that my people will still not accept you.",
"Who cares?!",
"I'm glad of that. Well, good luck to you.",
"If you need anything, you're welcome.",
"(To both): Okay, stop swearing. Whether you like it or not, you're working together now.",
"That's lucky, so lucky...",
"So, your mission is to find out where the squadron of these scum is based now and destroy it. And I beg of you, for the duration of this mission, forget about your quarrels.",
"All right. But if he says one more word to me, then I'm not responsible for myself!",
"(To Barracuda): Barracuda, I'm asking you to keep your mouth shut. (To you): The same goes for you, ",
"Okay. Can we get started?",
"Proceed.",
"...",
"Hmm... Proceed as soon as there is a place for Barracuda in your squadron.",
"Oh, really, there are no places! But I'll think of something now and tell Barracuda when he can join me.",
"By the way, you might want to move your ships to Leviathan Rock. My ships will join you there. We don't want the fort to join in the fight.",
"Certainly not! The governor's fleet will probably be dangerous enough without the fort supporting them.",
"Well, #sNathaniel#, where is your fleet now?",
"Still in port. Thanks for reminding me. I'll go back to town and move it now.",
"At Sunny Haven. Send your ships there to meet mine.",
"At Linda Prais. Your ships should also go there.",
"At Leviathan Rock, waiting for your ships.",
"Why are you here, ",
"? My associate reported that you were not interested in what I wanted to say to you.",
"I apologise. I had a lot on my mind at that time. The last thing I needed was another task.",
"That is understandable. And I accept your apology. Now I have an offer for you.",
"I'm listening.",
"Lord Beckett",
