"You could prove your loyalty to #sgov_nation# through your assistance.",
"It seems I have misplaced my ship, #saddr#. But I cannot do much damage to our enemies without one.",
"This is no laughing matter! You are lucky that we need all available captains. I shall give you a new command rather than drag you in front of a court martial, but don't expect a promotion any time soon!",
"I will not let you down, #saddr#. That I promise!",
"You are a disgrace to my great nation! You are hereby dishonourably discharged from the service. Get out of my sight!",
