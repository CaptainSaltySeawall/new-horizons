"Ah good! My employer only has 200 coins for you now. But he also has this tar. This will allow you to set arrows ablaze before you shoot them and inflict more damage on your oponents. If I give you 5 of that too would it be a deal?",
"That sounds like a deal to me.",
"I think I'll keep the bows. They should be worth more.",
"To bad... I hope you will change your mind.",
"Bye.",
