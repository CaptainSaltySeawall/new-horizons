"Help! Help! They're after me, please help!",
"Aah! Please help me, kind sir! Rescue me from these bastards!",
"Please, have mercy and protect me from these villains. I beg you!",
"What's going on here?",
"What's this business about?",
"What's the trouble?",
"They... They want to ravish me! I beg you, protect me!",
"These beasts... They want my maidenhead! Protect me from them, please!",
"In the name of God, sir, protect me from these foul monsters! They want to disgrace me!",
"Ahh, now I understand.",
"Oh sir, I thank thee for the help!",
"You've rescued me! I'm so grateful to you! Certainly it would be no disgrace to share a bed with a hero like you...",
"You're my knight in shining armor! Many thanks to thee, kind sir.",
"There's only one way to treat bilge rats like these.",
"I have only a little money. Please take it as a token of my gratitude.",
"Thank you. Please do be more cautious next time.",
"I shall tell everyone that you rescued me! They'll know what a brave and kind gentleman you are!",
"Thank you. Now you'd best be getting home.",
"I have but a few coins. Please take them with my humble thanks.",
"Thanks. You've got to watch out for villains like these.",
"Don't be so nervous, friend! I was only joking. We're leaving.",
"Alright, alright! We've changed our minds. You're nothing but a washed up old hag anyway.",
"You're quite the hero, aren't you? Well, this time you may have won, but we'll be laying for you, you bloody bastard.",
"Now you've asked for it...",
"So you'd spoil our fun eh? Well, we'll spoil your giblets.",
"Good to see you've made the right choice. Now off with ye!",
"There's no turning back now. We'll meet ye next in the lake of fire, lad!",
"Afraid of us, matey? I'm afraid I can't let you leave alive!",
"I'm sorry but I can't help you, miss.",
"You could have left well enough alone, but now you'll pay with the price... in blood!",
"This is your own doing! Die!",
"So that's it, eh? We'll tear you to pieces! We'll cut out your liver and roast it over our campfire!",
"Try it!",
"Hand over your doubloons and then ye'd best run before we decide to make sport of ye.",
"So nice to deal with compliant lads. Get goin', then.",
"Thanks for the gold, and here's some free advice. Stay out of the jungle. Sit in a tavern in port and suck rum -- rum may rot your guts but it won't spill them.",
"Damn your eyes!",
"You want us to surrender to your lily-livered arse? We'll tickle your ribs, we will. Money's easy enough to take from a corpse.",
"God's teeth!",
"You again? We let you off once. Now run along, lass, before we change our minds.",
"So you've found more gold in your pockets to share with us, eh? Wonderful! Har-har!",
"Now you've really raked my stern, lad! Get out of my sight before I poke your kidneys wi' me poniard!",
"Alright, I'm going! .",
"I've thought about it, and I'm back to give you what you deserve!",
"What do you want? Get out of here!",
"Get away from here! Leave us to our business! Don't come back!",
"Begone, ye bleedin' blighter! Or by gawd ye'll pay a dear price for yer peepin'.",
"I'm leavin' already, mates.",
"Your evil deeds can't go unpunished!",
"Get away from me! I want to live! Get out of here!",
"Help! He's a maniac! I don't want to die!",
"Spare me! I'm but a lowly filcher! I'm too young to die!",
"Ye'd live longer if ye'd sit at home on yer rocker, matey!",
