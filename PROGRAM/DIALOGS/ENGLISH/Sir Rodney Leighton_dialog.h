"Congratulations on your promotion to ",
"Thank you, sir.",
"Why are you still here? You know your duty - be about it!",
"Er, yes, sir.",
"I have orders for you. You are to take a consignment of muskets and ammunition, and deliver them to a rebel named ",
". He has taken over the fort at Playa de Sabana.",
"I am familiar with that fort, sir. We blew it up to prevent a bunch of rebels from taking it over. If I may ask, sir, why are we helping them now?",

" as he is known to be a man of a violent temper.",
"I see, sir. Hopefully that temper will be vented on the Spanish.",
"That is the general idea, yes. Now, the weapons are already being loaded onto your ship. Finish provisioning her, then sail to Playa de Sabana as soon as possible.",
"Yes, sir.",
"That is the general idea, yes. But I am informed that your ship is already heavily laden. Clear out some space in your hold, then return here. I will then order the ammunition to be loaded aboard the ",
"Yes sir. I shall go to the store now.",
"You still do not have enough space required for the powder you are to take. Clear more space, ",
"Very good, ",

". You are to leave for Playa de Sabana as soon as possible.",
"Very good, sir. I shall set sail for Playa de Sabana as soon as I am aboard the ",
"Now, the French have sent a squadron of four ships of the line to #sisland_Hispaniola#. They will probably anchor at #sPort au Prince#.\nYou will join my squadron. We shall blockade #sPort au Prince# and bottle the French force up in harbour.",
"Beg pardon, sir, but what if the French squadron anchors at #sSanto Domingo# instead?",
"Hmm. What do you suggest, ",
"Perhaps I could take the ",
" to #sSanto Domingo# to see whether the French are there.",
"Indeed. I have read about your career, ",
". Very prone to taking individual action. After the prize money for yourself, what?",
"Certainly not, sir!",
"Hmm. Very well. When we approach #sisland_Hispaniola#, you are to detach from my squadron. You will proceed to #sSanto Domingo# and ascertain whether the French ships are there.\nIf they are, you are to join me at #sPort au Prince#. We will then blockade #sSanto Domingo# instead.\nUnder no circumstances are you to engage the French fleet by yourself. Is that understood, ",
"Understood, sir.",
" at your service, sir.",
"Lady Barbara Wellesley is aboard, is she not?",
"She's been informed of your arrival, sir.",
"Your exploits at sea, ",

"The captain of a frigate doesn't normally decide Admiralty policy.",
"There was no way of consulting the Admiralty, or I would have done so.",
"But really, Hornblower - giving away a 60 gun prize to a madman!",
"I stood ready to answer for my actions, sir.",
"Had you been serving under my command, you'd have answered for it alright! A court martial might have considered your action irresponsible.\nIn addition, it caused you to risk the life of the Duke of Wellington's sister.",
"I apologise for that, sir.",
"It would have gone very hard for you, ",
", if anything had happened to her. I too value Lady Barbara highly. We're to be married.",
"Yes, so Lady Barbara has told me, sir.",
"I suppose a ship of this size is rather confining, and confidences are likely to be freer than under normal circumstances.",
"Here you are, at last, my dear. You've no idea how concerned I've been for your welfare.",
"Shall we go? Your family waits impatiently for you in London, and after that, my family in Ireland.",
