"I don't think so. But I should be going now.",
"I won't be long. Just long enough to ask you a quick question.",
"And what question would that be?",
"You see, I want to take the young lady there to a nice seaside picknick if you catch my drift. I thought you might know at what hour to do this best.",
"Ah, I see! Good luck with that, lad; I never even got a kiss from her. I suggest you go ",

"Oh, don't worry about me.",
"Well... If you truly want this information you could pay me, say, ",
" to 'accidentally' spill the beans and forget this meeting ever happened.",
"That sounds like a fair deal to me.",
"You know what? I'll buy you a drink and you just forget this ever happened. How's that?",
"What happened? Like I said, just leave me alone!",
"Your best chance is ",
". There shouldn't be many guards at that time.",
"Thank you very much. I shall bother you no more.",
"You look like the kind of guy who likes to bet. I want to know when the beach will be empty. I've got plenty of gold to offer.",
"I'm up for a bet if you wager ",
"Okay, you're on!",
"Sorry, I have changed my mind.",
