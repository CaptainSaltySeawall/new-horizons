"EEEK! What are you doing in my bedroom? Are you a thief? Please don't hurt me! I'll give you my jewels if you leave me alone.",
"Believe me, I'm not going to hurt you, sweetheart! Quite the contrary, hehe...",
"If I only had more time then I'd take something else from you, lass! But for now I'll be content with those jewels. Thank's a lot.",
"Mylady, no jewels can be as beautiful as your lovely face! Your eyes shine brighter as the brightest diamond, and for just a smile from you will I gladly forfeit even the crownjewels. Keep your gems and a fond memory of me. So long.",
"You'd better run while you still can. I hear my husband coming home... with his bodyguards!",
"BODYGUARDS? I'd love to chat a little longer, but I have pressing business elsewhere. Goodbye, Beauty!",
