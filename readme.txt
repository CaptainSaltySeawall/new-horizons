4.0 Addendum


4.1 Rank and Ship Class relationship. 

The manual mentions the player's rank will limit the class of ship that the player can steer. This is incorrect. The player's rank does not limit the player's ability to steer or command a larger ship.

4.2 Skill limit

The manual mentions the player can raise their skills by hiring officers, while this is true the player cannot raise their skills beyond the skill cap of 10, even when hiring officers. All skills are maxed out at 10.


4.3 Cannons and culverines


The manual makes mention that heavier cannons fire further than lighter cannons. While heavier cannons do inflict more damage, the range is shorter than lighter variants.

Culverines do fire at greater distances but require longer load times and they inflict less damage.

Please review the statistics for both cannons and culverines when equipping to determine which type best suits your skills.
