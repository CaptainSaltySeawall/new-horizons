title=Arrival in Philipsburg
text.t1=Having finally arrived in these strange and uncivilized waters, the time has come to cast the light of knowledge and understanding over the details of what has become of the goods ordered by our company, that were never brought across the seas in the direction opposite of the one I just traversed. I will first talk to the owner of the local store, who should have records of our transaction, and then go to the local tavern to interview the men that prepared the packages for transit. The mystery of the one (1) missing coconut will not remain a mystery for long!
