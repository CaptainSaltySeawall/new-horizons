title=Wait for new orders from Silehard.
text.t1=Silehard ordered me to participate in the liberation of #sOxbay# on #sisland_Oxbay#. Unfortunately, I have little choice; all the city's entrances are blocked. The only thing I can do is await his orders in the tavern.
text.t2=What the devil! The English soldiers attacked Danielle and me! Danielle, of course, disappeared immediately after the fight - I suppose she is hiding something from me. Poor girl, she nearly cried - her boatswain Ralph was killed. That's unfortunate; he was a good man. In any case, I need to figure out what's going on here.
text.t3=I should have listened to Danielle and gotten out of that tavern. As soon as Danielle left, the soldiers entered the tavern and told me to lay down my arms. There were four of them, so the odds were in their favor and I was forced to yield. What the devil is going on?
