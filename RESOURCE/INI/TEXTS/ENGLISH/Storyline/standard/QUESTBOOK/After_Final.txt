title=After Final
text.t1=Well, the big battle is over and we've defeated the Black Pearl, which would have been impossible if not for that artifact Danielle found. I wonder what the English think of us now! They must know Silehard betrayed them. Perhaps if we sail to #sRedmond# on #sisland_Redmond# there will be a reward. But no diplomat will be able to fix this unless we give them all we've gained, and I won't do that! We should take Clement back to his lighthouse home on #sisland_Oxbay# first, then off to #sisland_Redmond#. We'll have to get into town the back way, overland from Rocky Shore, just in case the English still feel unkindly towards us. But I have a feeling it will be all right. 
text.t2=So Danielle will keep her immortality amulet, and stay always. We make a good team. Better to have her blade by my side than in my side! All is well.
text.t3=So Danielle goes. Shakespeare said parting is sweet sorrow, but I'd be willing to wager he never said goodbye to Danielle Greene! It's better this way. We're both too independent. It's not the end, though. We can't seem to avoid each other, so I'm sure we'll meet again. All is well.
text.t4=So Danielle will get rid of that silly immortality amulet, which I'm sure means nothing. We make a good team. Better to have her blade by my side than in my side! All is well.
text.t5=Clement seems to be pretty worn out by all the excitement. We should get him home.
